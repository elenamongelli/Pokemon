1. Remove Personal Identifiers and Create Pseudonyms (id, pokemonName)
2. Generalize Data using Ranges (height, weight)
3. Data Aggregation -> Use aggregated values instead of individual measurmennts (BMI only instead of height, weight)
4. Limit Precision of numerical data
5. Data Encryption -> convert plaintext data into cyphertext
Other consideration (not strictly related with pseudonymization)
1. Storing Data choices -> are all the data necessary (id, pokemonName, pokedexOrder, pics)? 
2. Subject Access Request -> given the pokemon Name, it's easy to delete it
